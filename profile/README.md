# 🌀 Singulix Labs: Intelligence Beyond Boundaries  

*Imagine a world where AI isn’t centralized, where intelligence evolves openly, and where innovation isn’t locked behind corporate walls.*  

This isn’t just an idea. **This is Singulix Labs.**  

We build **decentralized AI**—not as a product, but as a movement. A revolution where developers, researchers, and visionaries craft intelligent systems that belong to no one… and everyone.
